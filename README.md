 <h1>Flask OpenAI Chatbot Webhook</h1>
This is a Flask web application that serves as a webhook for a chatbot, using OpenAI's text completion API to generate responses to user input.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

To use this application, you will need an OpenAI API key, which can be obtained from the OpenAI website. Once you have your API key, you can set it as an environment variable in your terminal:

javascript

    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

You will also need to install the required Python packages by running:

    pip install flask openai

After installing the required packages, you can start the Flask application by running:

    python app.py

The application will start running on http://localhost:8000 by default.
<h2>Usage</h2>

To use the chatbot webhook, you can send a POST request to the /webhook endpoint with a JSON payload containing the user's input text. The payload should have the following format:

json

    {
    "queryResult": {
        "queryText": "Hello, how are you?"
    }}

The application will use the input text as a prompt to generate a response using OpenAI's text completion API. The generated text will be returned in a JSON format as the fulfillment text:

json

    {
    "fulfillmentText": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How can I help you today?"
    }

If an error occurs during processing, the application will return a random witty response in the fulfillmentText field.
<h2>Configuration</h2>

The application uses environment variables to store configuration settings. The following variables can be set:

    OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key.
    COMPANY_DESCRIPTION: A description of your company to use in the prompt template. Default is an empty string.
    CEO_PROFILE: A profile of the CEO to use in the prompt template. Default is an empty string.
    PROMPT_TEMPLATE: The prompt template to use for generating responses. Default is a generic template with placeholders for the company description and CEO profile.

<h2>Customization</h2>

To customize the chatbot's behavior, you can modify the following settings in the app.py file:

    model: The OpenAI model to use for text completion. Default is text-davinci-003.
    temperature: The sampling temperature to use for text generation. Default is 0.9.
    max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response. Default is 150.
    top_p: The top p probability mass to use for text generation. Default is 1.
    frequency_penalty: The frequency penalty to use for text generation. Default is 0.0.
    presence_penalty: The presence penalty to use for text generation. Default is 0.6.
    stop: The stop sequence to use for text generation. Default is ["Human:", " AI:"].
