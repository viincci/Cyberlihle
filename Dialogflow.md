Welcome to the Cyberly documentation! This documentation is designed to help you understand and use the AI chatbot built using Dialogflow and GPT-3 API.
Introduction

The Cyberly AI chatbot is an intelligent assistant that is capable of understanding natural language queries and providing relevant responses. The chatbot is built using Dialogflow, a powerful natural language processing platform, and GPT-3 API, a state-of-the-art language model that is capable of generating human-like responses.
Getting Started

Before you can start using the Cyberly chatbot, you will need to create a Dialogflow project and connect it to the GPT-3 API. Here are the steps to get started:

Create a Dialogflow project in the Google Cloud Console.
Enable the Dialogflow API and create a new agent.
Import the Cyberly agent ZIP file into your Dialogflow project.
Set up the GPT-3 API key and secret in the Cyberly backend script.
Start the Cyberly backend script and connect it to your Dialogflow agent.

**Using the Chatbot**

Once you have set up the Cyberly chatbot, you can start using it to interact with your users. Here are some tips for using the chatbot effectively:

Make sure your Dialogflow intents and entities are properly configured to handle user queries.
Test your chatbot thoroughly to ensure that it is providing accurate and relevant responses.
Use fallback intents to handle queries that the chatbot is unable to answer.
Continuously monitor and improve the chatbot's performance by analyzing user feedback and making adjustments to the training data.

**Adding Intents from Previous Convesations**

Step 1: Analyze the conversations

Before adding new intents, take some time to analyze the previous conversations. Look for patterns, common phrases or questions, and topics that come up frequently. This will help you identify which intents need to be added or updated.

Step 2: Create new intents

Based on the analysis of the previous conversations, create new intents for the topics that were not covered by existing intents. You can do this by clicking the "Create Intent" button and giving it a name that reflects the topic it covers.

Step 3: Add training phrases and responses

Once you have created a new intent, add training phrases and responses that match the way people naturally talk about the topic. Use the actual language from the previous conversations as much as possible. You can also use the "Add Examples" button to add more training phrases.

Step 4: Test the new intents

After adding new intents, test them to make sure they work as expected. You can do this by using the "Try it now" feature in the intent editor, or by testing the agent in the Dialogflow console.

Step 5: Train the model

After adding new intents and testing them, train the model by clicking the "Train" button in the Dialogflow console. This will update the agent's understanding of the topics covered by the new intents.

Step 6: Monitor and refine

As the agent interacts with more users, monitor its performance and refine the intents as needed. Use the "View Training" feature to see which phrases are being matched to which intents, and adjust the intents and training phrases as necessary to improve accuracy.
